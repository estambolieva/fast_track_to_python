## Unit Tests with [nose](http://pythontesting.net/framework/nose/nose-introduction/) and PyCharm  
  
1. nose - have the python code in a directory projects, and have the unit tests in a directory tests.  
  
To run tests, go to the tests directory in the terminal, and simply run  
```javascript
nosetests
```  
  
To see which tests have been executed, run nose in verbose mode:  
```javascript
nosetests -v
```  
  
2. PyCharm  
  * new test
  * auto test (+ setting a delay)
  * create multiple tests within a TestClass
