1. What is H2O on Python  
H2O helps Python users make the leap from single machine based processing to large-scale distributed environments. Hadoop lets H2O users scale their data processing capabilities based on their current needs. Using H2O, Python, and Hadoop, you can create a complete end-to-end data analysis solution.  
  
Native Python and Seamless Hadoop Integration
H2O can run as a standalone platform or within an existing Hadoop installation, bringing in-memory performance to Hadoop. H2O works with data in HDFS and supports familiar programming tools, such as Hive and Pig. In addition, the solution can be efficiently run in Amazon Web Services environments.
